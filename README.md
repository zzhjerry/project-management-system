# Project Management System

## Architecture

### Backend (`/server`)

All `post` request should use `json` as format (i.e. Send `Content-Type: application/json` in the header)

API endpoints are grouped under `/api` url with following routes:

**POST `/api/auth/login`**: 302

redirect user to `/dashboard`. Assign a session that expires in 2 weeks.

**GET `/api/auth/logout`**: 302

redirect user to `/`. Clear `req.user`, doesn't clear session.

**POST `/api/users`**: 302

redirect user to `/dashboard`. Create user in DB

**GET `/api/projects`**: 200

get a list of projects with an array of assigned experts with corresponding status

**POST `/api/projects`**: 201

create a project

**All other routes and request methods not listed above will return 404**

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites

Assume you have following softwares installed, if not, see link behind for instruction

- MongoDB ([install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)): `mongod` is needed to start `development` and `testing` database

### Choice of libraries

- Util: [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4)
- Promise: [bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html)
- Linting: [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [standard](https://github.com/standard/standard)
- Test framework: [mocha](https://mochajs.org/))
- API Integration test: [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
- Assertion Library: [chai/assert](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/)

### Data Models

> User

- **email (string, required)**: account to login
- **password (string, required)**: minimum 8 chars, encrypted with `bcrypt`

> Project

- **status (string, required, default:new)**: new, pending, expired
- **title (string, required)**: project title
- **slug (string, required)**: slugified version of project title + epoch timestamp

`slug` is used to prettify url of a project's detail view. It will be used to query project document.
It is unique and cannot be changed once the document is created. A validation error will occur if someone tries to
`POST` a different slug to `/api/projects/:slug` endpoint.

- **experts (array, optional)**: an array of choosen experts for the choosen project with status in following schema

``` javascript
{
  expert: ObjectId,
  status: ["approved", "rejected"]
}
```

#### embeded vs reference:

I use reference to store `expert` in `experts` because it saves more space as the growth of number of projects,
number of experts per project and expert profile length.

> Expert

- **firstname (string, required)**
- **lastname (string, optional**

### Authentication

- session based authentication (instead of token based authentication)

Token based authentication (JWT) is the new trend and has various advantages introduced
[here](https://auth0.com/blog/cookies-vs-tokens-definitive-guide/). But consider
that this is a project management system that is intended to be used by internal
staffs instead of millions of users outside, and both frontend and backend will
be served on the same domain, session based authentication is enough to handle
all requirements.

- implementation of session based authentication

Inspired by [this artical](https://medium.com/of-all-things-tech-progress/starting-with-authentication-a-tutorial-with-node-js-and-mongodb-25d524ca0359).
Also use [passport](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/) as it's quite reliable and mature for
various authentication needs.
